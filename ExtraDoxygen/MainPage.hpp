/** @mainpage

This is Diluculum's documentation page, as you can probably guess from the
title. Read the \ref pag-UsersGuide "User's Guide" or use the links at the
page's top to navigate through the Diluculum's Reference.

Also, the tests found at the \c Tests directory under the source distribution
use every single Diluculum feature available, so they serve as working examples
on how to use this library.

Quick facts about Diluculum:

- It is distributed under the MIT license (the same as Lua).
- Its homepage is located at
  <A href="http://www.stackedboxes.org/~lmb/en/diluculum">
