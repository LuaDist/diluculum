 DILUCULUM COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=====================================================


 Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Apart from Lua, Diluculum depends only on Boost
(http://www.boost.org).


 How to use Diluculum in your project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I strongly recommend adding Diluculum source and header files to your
project, so that it gets compiled and linked with your application by
your own build system.

Diluculum is reasonably small, so adding it to your project won't make
it so much larger. And, since Diluculum is not widely used, adding it
as an external dependency to your project would just upset your users.


 Building as a standalone library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you decide to ignore the advice on the previous section, or if you
want to help with the development of Diluculum, the way to go is
building with CMake. This way, you can easily compile and link the
library and its unit tests.

If you don't know how to use CMake, I suggest searching for some
tutorial on how to use it. Anyway, under a Unix-like system, building
should look like this:

  $ cd <diluculum sources root directory>
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make
